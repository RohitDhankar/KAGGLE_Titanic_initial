## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Load packages
library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualization
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
library('randomForest') # classification algorithm
#

train <- read.csv('train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

full  <- bind_rows(train, test) # bind training & test data

# check data
str(full)

#
# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)

# Show title counts by sex
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Dhankar -- No Merging of Titles Done - Hold on to the RARE Title thingie 
#

########################
# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
# rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
#                 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')
# 
# # Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
# full$Title[full$Title == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
# full$Title[full$Title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
# full$Title[full$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
# full$Title[full$Title %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'
########################


# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

#
# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
full$Surname <- sapply(full$Name,  
                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])

#table(full$Surname, full$Sex)
# 875 Unique Surnames 
nlevels(factor(full$Surname))

#
# Create a family size variable including the passenger themselves
full$Fsize <- full$SibSp + full$Parch + 1

# Create a family variable 
full$Family <- paste(full$Surname, full$Fsize, sep='_')

# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between family size & survival
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(x = Fsize, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:11)) +
  labs(x = 'Family Size') +
  theme_few()

#
# Discretize family size
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize == 1] <- 'singleton'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize < 5 & full$Fsize > 1] <- 'small'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize > 4] <- 'large'

# Show family size by survival using a mosaic plot
mosaicplot(table(full$FsizeD, full$Survived), main='Family Size by Survival', shade=TRUE)


 #This CABIN variable appears to have a lot of missing values
full$Cabin[1:28]


# The first character is the deck. For example:
strsplit(full$Cabin[2], NULL)[[1]]

# Create a Deck variable. Get passenger deck A - F:
full$Deck<-factor(sapply(full$Cabin, function(x) strsplit(x, NULL)[[1]][1]))

full$Deck[1:10]
# 1 to 10 Values of full$Deck with various Levels 

# TBD --- 3.1 Sensible value imputation
# Onwards 




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
